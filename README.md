# Restaurant Management System (C)

##  Project Overview
The **Restaurant Management System** is a console-based application developed in **C** as part of the SDF Semester 1 final submission.
It allows restaurant owners and customers to manage menus, orders, logins, and billing efficiently using file handling.
This project demonstrates the practical application of core **C programming concepts** in a real-world use case.
This project was developed to strengthen understanding of file handling and real-world data management using C.
